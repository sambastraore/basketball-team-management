# basketball-team-management
This is a django web app for managing the statistics of a basketball team. 
It includes functionalities like : 
- Accessing the team members and their basic infos
- Filling in the score sheet for the team members.
- Accessing the historic of games.

It's not so evolutive, it can be considered as static (we cannot add new team members). It was for academic purpose. What's interesting is the way it manages the game statistics.
Switch to ***dev*** branch to see the app.
