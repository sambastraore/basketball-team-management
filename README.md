# basketball-team-management
This is a django web app for managing the statistics of a basketball team. 
It includes functionalities like : 
- Accessing the team members and their basic infos
- Filling in the score sheet for the team members.
- Accessing the historic of games.

It's not so evolutive, it's a little bit static (we cannot add new team members). It was for academic purpose. 
Switch to ***dev*** branch to see the app.
